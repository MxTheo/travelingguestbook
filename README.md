## Empowers people to start conversations
### Description
The aim of this web-application is to facilitate conversation starters with people they do not know, for example people in the train.

It is a web-application where people that received a code on a sociable, can leave a message.

Sociables are the conversation starters.
Sociables are physical items that are passed on from person to person. The physical sociable has a code, that is used to find the page of the sociable. Every time it is passed on, the person who received it leaves a message on the sociable page.
Sociables have goals, which can be a question to answer in a message.
